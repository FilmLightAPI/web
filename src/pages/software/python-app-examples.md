- **dialog_object_items_showcase.py** Creates a dialog that allows user to individually view all supported DialogItem types.
- **dialog_object_with_timer.py** Define a dialog class which uses DynamicDialog to present a dialog to the user. It uses the timer callback to update asynchronously.

- **select_scene_and_open.py** shows a dialog with a scene picker, then opens the selected scene in the Baselight timeline (requires 7.0.1 or later).
- **dynamic_dialog_with_background_process.py** A DynamicDialog that validates input against a slow (fake) server without freezing the UI
- **custom-queue-operation.zip** An app script and server script that run slow work in the background via a custom Queue Manager operation
