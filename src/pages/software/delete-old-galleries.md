Delete old gallery scenes from the job database (based on modified date)

![Screenshot](/web/screenshots/delete-old-galleries-1.jpg)

The processing can be very slow for large jobs, so work is done in the backgroud and managed via the Queue Monitor.

## How To Use

Select *Delete Old Galleries* from under the main *Baselight* menu.

If you're not using the default "baselight_gallery" job for your galleries, you'll need to edit the script with your custom job name (matching your _Preferences > Cuts View, Gallery and Scratchpad > Gallery Job_ setting).

## Installation

Select **Views > Scripts** and on the **Packages** tab press "**Install package file...**", then browse to your downloads and select *filmlight_delete_old_galleries-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl*

## How to Modify

Rather than using the package, you can install the files manually:
- **DeleteOldGalleries_ui.py** into /vol/.support/scripts/
- **DeleteOldGalleries_server.py** into /vol/.support/server-scripts/

You may have to create the folders if they don't exist. Outside of the package, the objects will need to be initalized by adding a line to the bottom of each file:

- DeleteOldGalleries_ui.py
```
DOGUI()
```

- DeleteOldGalleries_server.py
```
DOGServer()
```

After making changes to the UI script you can just reload scripts in the Scripts View to pickup the changes. If you change the server script you'll have to restart the flapi daemon with:

```
sudo fl-service flapi restart 
```

If you want to rebuild the package, run:

```
make-wheel.sh
```
