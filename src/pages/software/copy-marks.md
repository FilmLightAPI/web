Copy Shot or Timeline marks from one scene to another.

![Screenshot](/screenshots/copy-marks-1.jpg)

## How To Use

Select *Copy Marks From Scene...* or *Copy Shot Marks From Scene...* under the main *Scene* menu.

Both the scene you want to copy marks FROM and INTO must be open. The scene you want to copy INTO should be the active scene. You can choose which other open scene you want to copy marks FROM.

- Timeline marks can be offset by a set number of frames in the new scene
- Shot marks are copied to corresponding shots by matching tape or clip names (user selectable)

## Installation

Place `CopyShotMarks.py` and/or `CopyTimelineMarks.py` into the */vol/.support/scripts* folder which is the same as
- **Linux:** /usr/fl/scripts
- **MacOS:** /Library/Application Support/FilmLight/scripts

Restart Baselight or select *Views > Scripts > <span style="display:inline-block; vertical-align: middle;">![Gear](/gear.png)</span> > Reload Scripts…* to load.
