Auto-generate formats for all media in a scene.

This script applies a standard mapping to the working format for all shots in a scene, creating formats as needed.

To use, select **Generate Formats** under the main Baselight or Daylight menu.

## Options

**Mapping Options**
- *Fit Width* - Fit the left and right edges of the source media to the left and right of the working format. May result in letter-boxing or the top and bottom being cropped.
- *Fit Height* - Fit the top and bottom edges of the source media to the top and bottom of the working format. May result in pillar-boxing or the sides being cropped.
- *Fit All Inside* - Fit the entire source frame within the working format. May result in letter-boxing or pillar-boxing.
- *Fill Frame* - Fill the entire working format, may result in cropping either the top and bottom OR the sides of the source media.

**Prefix name for generated formats**

Auto-generated formats will be given this prefix, for example if the prefix is "GF" an auto-generated format for a 4448x3096 source will be named "GF 4448x3096"

**Replace/Override assigned formats**
- ☐ (unchecked) formats and mappings will only be generated for shots with basic formats (the source resolution surrounded by parenthesis)
- ☒ (checked) format mapping will be updated for ALL shots, even if already assigned a named format
