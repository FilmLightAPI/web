Generate a matte that highlights the contours in an image

It can be used for numerous effects, such as halation, blooming and adding or subtracting color fringing.

## How to Use

With an image source in your timeline selected, apply the *EdgeDetectShaderExample_v1.blg.exr* BLG by loading it in FLUX Manage. This will automatically load the shader with an example of how it is used.

## Installation

To manually install the shader (rather than using the BLG), unzip and place files into the */vol/.support/shaders* folder which is the same as
- **Linux:** /usr/fl/shaders
- **MacOS:** /Library/Application Support/FilmLight/shaders
