Select multiple short frame ranges for rendering reference clips.

This script generates a list of frame ranges for selected shots that can be pasted directly into the render page.
It is useful for rendering short segments of a project to give a quick overview of the grade and its consistency.

## How To Use

Access **Custom Frame Range Selector** under the <span style="display:inline-block; vertical-align: middle;">![Gear](/web/gear.png)</span> menu in Shots view.

Modes:
 - Centered around Poster: Uses the shot's poster frame as center of the segments.
 - Centered around Middle: Uses always the mathematical center of the shot.
 - Starting/Ending: Segments are locked to the start or end of the shot.
 - Start and End Segments: Returns two segments per shot.
 - Across Cuts: Places the segments on the boundaries between shots.
 
The minimum shot length removes very short shots. Use 0 to include all shots.
 
The resulting frame range is copied to your clipboard and shown in an editable box
